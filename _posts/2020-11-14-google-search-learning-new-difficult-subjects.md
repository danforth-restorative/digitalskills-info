The most powerful skill I've developed is using google search to learn difficult subjects, and find much more information doing that than I can find anywhere else.

I've been using internet search since the days before google. I'm sure that has something to do with how I developed the talent, but I also value truth above ideology or what authority figures suggest I believe.

Whatever the case may be, I decided this post would be the cornerstone for the not-for-profit educational organization [digitalskills.info](https://digitalskills.info). This organization is meant to address the massive inefficiencies I percieve in institutional education.

If you know how to search the web, then you can learn anything. It's not always as fast as other learning techniques, and doesn't provide authoratative certification. However, searching the web to find out for myself is free, provides a great deal more confidence that my learning is beneficial, and draws upon a wealth of knowledge amassed across the globe, that's just recently become available to anyone with a mobile phone.

## Included in this Guide

* [Tools for collecting links](#Tools-for-collecting-links)
  * If you don't save the results of your search it can be difficult to know how to find what you've learned. Especially for big subjects, like any subject becomes if you dig a little, it's essential to keep track of where you've found useful information. 
* [Getting started with Google Search](#Getting-started-with-Google-Search)
  * In this section I go over some of my basic philosophy and practices when using google search.
* [How I process search results](#How-I-process-search-results)
  * If I'm trying to learn a deep subject, I never use a single search term. I always end up trying multiple searches, with different terms, informed by the results of my previous attempts. 
* [Narrowing down the results](#Narrowing-down-the-results)
  * Once I've got a few links I think will answer the core question I'm searching, I'll scan their contents to verify my intuition and add more order to the list of resources I'm building.
* [Organizing the list](#Organizaing-the-list)
  * Through this journey I'm collecting and organizing links, by topic, the whole time. The point of all this isn't just to answer the limited question I began with, but also explore it's boundries, and discover things I didn't even think to look for. Organizing my search results into an ordered list sorted by category, and then dig deeper on tangential topics, later.

## Tools for collecting links

Unlike a regular school that insists that repetition and memorization is the only way to learn, at DigitalSkills.Info, we're more focused on making it easier to find the information we need, when we need it.

For this, I'm sharing a couple tools that I use to keep track of useful resources I find along the way.

### Hackmd.io

![](https://i.imgur.com/ycy7700.png)

On a laptop\desktop computer, hackmd is great. Ultimately, there are a variety of applications you could use for collecting sources while learning on the web. However, hackmd is a simple and powerful tool that I still enjoy for the purpose.

[HackMD](https://hackmd.io) is a collaborative [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) editor. You can create an account simply using your google account, and create a document with a long funny address like the link to this post I'm writing:

https://hackmd.io/p6mEJJztQdWE1cmLSHHOrA

By default, anyone can see your work by going to that link, and anyone logged in can simultaniously edit with you. You can also configure your content to be private, or to allow anonymous editing. It keeps version history so you won't lose any of your work.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fvc55qd.png)

The split view is selected now (probably only available on desktop), in this way you can see the markdown, and final rednered view. On mobile you'll open directly to view mode, represented by the üëÅ (eye) icon. Or click the ‚úé (pencil) for edit view.

Markdown is great because it can be dropped into most any website builder. Although they don't all render markdown exactly the same. You can even publish right from hackmd if you prefer.

One cook feature I really enjoy with HackMD is that if you take a screenshot and paste it into the text editor, it will automatically upload to [imgur](https://imgur.com/), with proper markdown so it shows up on the view side of your screen.

* [Features](https://hackmd.io/s/features)
* [HackMD Tutorial Book](https://hackmd.io/s/tutorials)
* [HackMD Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/hackmd/)

If hackmd is too wild and crazy for you, just use your favorite text editor while following this guide. Then again, you might like the next tool I'm sharing, and end up using it for everything.

### Notion

Notion is another collaborative content creation \ personal management tool that's quite a bit more popular than hackmd and made to be easy for anyone regardless of how technical you are.

It's avalable as a mobile app that integrates with your share button, so you can save links to it while scrolling facebook, twitter, or google search. 

It also has an incredible desktop client. Both desktop and mobile have more useful features you can shake a stick at, and can be used to create web-pages with a simple graphical interface, without markdown or any other code.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/7lZFMxg.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL_N2pmh9O0)

[**See Notion in action**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL_N2pmh9O0)

Notion is more incredible than it initially reveals, and plenty of people are using it to organize their entire lives.

I have multiple Notion workspaces on different subjects, each with multiple pages covering different aspects of the subject. On desktop, whenever I find a page I need to save for reference, I simply click the browser extension, select the workspace and page in that space I want to keep my link. 

Later it's easy to find in Notion by search or navigating to the location it's saved.

## Getting started with Google Search

It's a lot easier to find what your looking for once you know how and where to look. This process has helped me learn where to find the information I'm looking for, and learn a ton more than I would using the conventional method of finding an answer and moving on to the next thing.

The use Google's search engine revolves primarily around keywords and key-phrases made of anywhere from one to multiple words. 

If your initial [query](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/query) doesn't provide the answers you're looking for, it takes a little creativity to figure out the right words or phrase related to your search that will provide the results you need.

For demonstration, I'm going to start with a more simplified and less useful search term, and work my way to more useful terms, as required when searching in a new topic you aren't familiar with.

### Before we begin

I like to begin with the shortest query possible, or if not the shortest, certainly not the longest. The longer your search query is, the more you're likely to get results unrelated to your needs.

#### Avoid Filler Words

"and" "of" "the" "if" "when" "too" google pretty much ignores these words, either way, they're not providing any value to your search results. 

#### Exact Matches

You can put one or more words in quotes together or individually, so that only results with that exact phrase is returned.

#### Helpful keywords for learning
There are a few keywords you can add to any search while fine tuning your query.

* how to
* tutorial
* tips and tricks
* guide
* ultimate guide
* advanced techniques

You get the idea, it's something you just have to play around with, until you get closer to what you're looking for. 

We'll go into some more advanced techniques later, but this is more than I knew a few years ago, so it's plenty to get started with.

## How I process search results

I want to learn tecniques to make the most of google search, and term I'm starting with is `google search`. so lets see what I come up with.

When I'm searching a new subject, I don't go through the results one by one reading an article at a time. Instead, I go through a few pages of results opening promising leads, each in a new tab, to sort through in bulk, after I've got a bunch of them open.

One thing to note here, is I typically avoid videos in the beginning, and am only looking for articles. 

Videos are great for certain subjects, but they usually have 5-10 mintues of filler at the beginning, and are hard to search. 

With an article I can quickly scroll\search the page to see if it has what I'm looking for before devoting much time to it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/CC1kOb2.png)

You can see by the initial search results that we can learn lots about Google and how it works, but not how to use it. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/9CI9Ldm.png)

You can see we're getting closer, since there is at least one useful result in the top 5. We could go on just ignoring the adwords guides, but lets try a new trick.

![](https://i.imgur.com/X3ZkCVV.png)

This time I added quotes around "google search" and used a minus next to adwords so we con't get any results containing that keyword.

The top 3 results are on target, so we'll continue with this query for now.

You can see I already opened the "Ultimate Guide to Google Search Operators" from the last search, since I know from experience that Semrush is a leader in SEO that creates excellent content. 

Below the post by [SEMRush](https://www.semrush.com/) is one by [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), and next is [SEOQuake](https://www.seoquake.com), three of the top SEO companies\tools around. While we're not trying to learn SEO, these companies are the authorities on content creation. 

Without even opening, I can confidently say that those three guides contain more than enough to keep us busy for quite some time.

Now, I'm going to go through the first 3 pages of search and open everything that looks on target in a new tab. This won't be necessary for this particular query, but I'm not just looking for tips on how to use google, but demonstrate how I use google, generally speaking.

...

So I got through to the 4th page of search, and there are tons of results about SEO, which I don't need. but I did get one more guide from [Moz](https://moz.com/) another leader in the field of SEO and content creation. This wasn't the point of this post, but if you're curious about SEO, you can begin browsing the content of any of those 4 sites.

Now I'm going to add `-SEO` to our query so I can remove SEO content from the results, and see what else I can dredge up.

...

Now I have a dozen or so pages open in my browser. Usually I get more than that, but browsing their titles can provide what we need for a better query if we don't find what we're looking for

These are the pages I've saved, without paying attention to their content, but for now only concerned that they are on-topic, and actually and article about searching the web, not an advertisement for a book I won't buy or something else that only superficially seemed helpful.

Recalling our search query was `ultimate guide "google search" -adwords -seo`, lets consider these titles. If I wasn't satisfied these results contained all of the information I needed, I would be looking for which keywords should become part of my next search query.

* Advanced Search
* Search Operators

If I was starting over again, I might try one or more of the following

* `"google search operators" ultimate guide`
* `"google search tips"`
* `"google advanced search" tutorial`
* `"google search operators" complete`

Another thing you'll notice from the links that I saved, is I've found some pages that are not entirely what I was looking for, but are likely to prove informative and useful.

Nows a good time to demonstrate how I'm using hackmd. If I find a page that's useful, but I don't need immediately, I make a bulleted list, with a quote blurb of each page, describing what's to be found. Then I can close that tab and move on. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/N8M2thn.png)

Commonly I'll repeat this process with perhaps 50 or 100 different web pages, until i've made a great list. I don't want a bunch of pages with the same content, but I want to highlight the most comprehensive resources on a given subject. Since these 4 pages are unique compared to the rest of our results they are a good place to start.

This first one is really interesting, and links to a guide on reserach beyond google, at the bottom. That's definitely going to come in handy.

* [The Ultimate Guide to the Invisible Web](https://oedb.org/ilibrarian/invisible-web/)
  > The vast majority of the Internet lies in the Deep Web, sometimes referred to as the Invisible Web. The actual size of the Deep Web is impossible to measure, but many experts estimate it is about 500 times the size of the web as we know it.
  * [Research Beyond Google: 56 Authoritative, Invisible, and Comprehensive Resources](https://oedb.org/ilibrarian/research-beyond-google/)

Next is a guide on google scholar, also not what I need at this moment, but I do want to get better at finding academic research, so I'll save that for now and move on.

* [Google Scholar: the ultimate guide](https://paperpile.com/g/google-scholar-guide/)
  > Google Scholar (GS) is a free academic search engine that can be thought of as the academic version of Google. Rather than searching all of the indexed information on the web, it searches repositories of publishers, universities or scholarly websites.

Up next is the ultimate guide to DuckDuckGo. If you're not already familiar it's a privacy focused search engine, and googles' top competitor for search. It's a tool I haven't gotten too deep into, but clearly now is the right time for that. At the moment, I'll simply save the link here.

* [The ultimate guide to DuckDuckGo](https://brettterpstra.com/2019/03/07/the-ultimate-guide-to-duckduckgo/)
  > If you don‚Äôt already have the scoop, it‚Äôs the search engine that can serve as a complete replacement for Google (and Bing and whatever else you like), except it respects your privacy and security. And while Google does some cool tricks, DuckDuckGo does some even better ones.

Finally, among our outliers is a guide to google tools, including search, covering the varieties of tools google makes available in exchange for spying on your every move.

* [A Guide to Google Tools: Tips and Tricks You Can't Live Without](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/guide-google-tools-tips-tricks-cant-live-without/)
  >  There are many Google services that have come and gone through the years, but a few of them -- like Gmail, Google Drive and of course Google Search -- stay even more relevant as time goes on.
  > 
  > The following is a comprehensive guide of tips, tricks, and hacks that'll help you make better use of Google services you use. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned expert, you're likely to find something here that you can add to your own productivity toolbox. 

If you're using notion, you would skip this step of highlighting each page individually.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wrOiBzu.png)

Instead of copy\pasting title\link\description manually, after you click the notion extention, you'll click the "Add to" drop-down, then select "New links database" then save your page to the database. It will give you the option to open that page, after saving your link, you can go and rename your database, and next link select that database, or make a new one if you're on a different subject completely.

That saves the entire page in notion. When you're done, that database can be exported as markdown\csv to sort through and make your list that way, or managed in Notion. 

I'll have a similar guide to this one, specifically focused on how I use notion, but that's a little more technical and beyond the scope of this article.

Now I can close those browser tabs, and focus on the results that make up the core of our query.

## Narrowing down the results

The next two pages seem like they'd be spot on, but aren't exactly what I'm looking for. Their scope goes beyond our core query into other useful techniques, specifically "Advanced Search", which is a graphical interface enabling most if not more features than the operators we're lookign for right now.

When working in another hackmd document, I'll put these at the bottom of the page with their own header "Advanced Search", and leave them alone for now. 

I'm positive I would find better results on 'advanced search' if I'd been searching specifically for that subject, but it didn't cross my mind, so it's helpful to add them to our list to expand upon later.

### [Advanced Search](https://hackmd.io/RoiESvORTMOpnFgPtJzYSw?both#Advanced-Search)

* [Google Advanced Search: Tips and Operators for Better Searches](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/google-advanced-search)
  > you don‚Äôt always want Google to give you 5,010,371 pages to choose from. Sometimes you want to know something precise. For example, which websites are linking to your store. Or how easy it is to find products in your store. Or what your competitors are selling.

## Organizing the list

Now that I've narrowed down my results, I'm going to browse\scan the entirety of each remaining page to see how they compare, and drop any whos contents are already covered in more extensive guides in the results.

I've made [another hackmd document](https://hackmd.io/RoiESvORTMOpnFgPtJzYSw?both) for the list I'm creating as a part of creating this guide. You can see from the following image, that the initial 4 posts I highlighted are all that's left for our core query, but we've got another category, and an assorted section that reveals a few more categories I can dig into and expand upon later.

(I added some tint to this screen shot so you can tell it's an image.)

[**Source**](https://hackmd.io/RoiESvORTMOpnFgPtJzYSw?both)

For each item on the list I'm selecting a short section to quote that describes what I find useful about its content, while I decide if I should keep it, and if so under what category it belongs, creating and consolidating categories as I go.

### [What are Google search operators?](https://moz.com/learn/seo/search-operators)

> Google search operators are special characters and commands (sometimes called ‚Äúadvanced operators‚Äù) that extend the capabilities of regular text searches. Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits

### [Google Search Operators: The Complete List (42 Advanced Operators)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/)
  
> In this post, I‚Äôll share 15 actionable tips to help you master search operators for SEO

This result has 42 operators, and tips on **using search operators for SEO**. Despite the title, it's not the most comprehensive list of search operators. I'd never even thought about using advanced operators to fine tune my website's search rankings. This will make the start of a new category I'll work on later. 

### [Google Search URL Parameters [Ultimate Guide]](https://www.seoquake.com/blog/google-search-param/)

This page has awesome **charts with the search operators *and* URL parameters**. This is more advanced, yet, and another section for the list I'm working on.

> The basic Google search is https://www.google.com/search?q=. It uses only one operator ‚Äúq= phrase of interest‚Äù(or as_q). The use of advanced search operators works like a password. Google clearly understands what you want from it and gives you the results for which the usual search would take much more time and filtering.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jcNwB8V.png)

#### Before we get to actual search operators I use, here's the list I've been working on.

You can see I've taken what was an unorganized list and broken it up into sections, while looking for the best guides on Google Search operators.

![](https://i.imgur.com/k7M9Ldn.png)

I'm not going to share every screenshot showing process along the way, however, if you visit the document above, you can click the [hamburger menu](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hamburger-menu.htm), and select "Versions and GitHub Sync" to follow my journey every step of the way.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QMrWvc6.png)

I'll be repeating the process described above, continuing the creation of a curated list that will be useful to myself, and others. Variations on above steps will be covered next, now I've settled on a guide to Google Search operators. 

## [Google Search Operators](https://moz.com/learn/seo/search-operators)

I've narrowed down our results to this post by moz which is reasonably comprehensive, without being bogged down by extraneous details.

The following search operators take you a long way towards more accurate search results. I've taken the most relevant from above Moz post, and even includes a couple they didn't mention.

You'll see from the examples below this search could have been accomplished much more efficiently using these special search commands. That's all part of the process, and hopefully illustrates the usefulness of this process.

### Basic Search Operators

Some of these have alternative expressions, as is the case for `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, which you'll see may also be expressed as  `.` `|` and `-`, respectively.

* `" "` **_Example_**: `"search operators" google`
    * As mentioned earlier, using quotation marks gives you only pages with an exact match for a term or phrase, avoiding synonyms. As you saw, you can put quotes around only part of the phrase and include additional terms outside of the quotes that aren't essential but you're hoping will narrow down results.
* `OR` **_Example_**: `"search operators" google OR duckduckgo`
  * `|` ‚Äì **_Example_**: `"search operators" google | duckduckgo` 
    * "OR" Must be in all caps. This query finds all pages with the terms "search operators" including results with either google or duckduckgo.
* `AND` **_Example_**: `"search operators" advanced AND parameters`
  * `.` ‚Äì **_Example_**: `"search operators" advanced . parameters`
    * Google defaults to AND for every word in your search, but this is useful for more complex queries when combining operators, as we'll see next.
* `NOT` **_Example_**: `"search operators" google NOT duckduckgo`
  * `-` **_Example_**: `"search operators" google -duckduckgo`
    * Minus operator must be placed directly in front of term you want excluded from the results. 
* **( )** - **_Example_**: `"search operators" (google OR duckduckgo) advanced`	
  * The parentheses group operators together, so you can be sure google knows you want 'google OR duckduckgo' also containing advanced, rather than 'google OR duckduckgo advanced'. 
  * Parentheses also "controls the order in which they execute"   
    * [Search Protocol Reference](https://support.google.com/gsa/answer/6329265#436b47a9-affc-48a8-869c-fff1dbd1abe0)
      > Boolean operators are left associative with equal precedence. You can use parentheses to change the order of precedence. For example, A . (B | C | D) evaluates the OR (|) operators in the parentheses before the AND (.) operator. It is advisable to use brackets, braces, or parenthesis to clarify the precedence in complex queries.
* `*` **_Example_**: `"search * parameters"`
  * The asterisk is a wildcard, finding results with any word between the search and parameters. This example would include results containing 'search url parameters' or 'search advanced parameters'
* `#..#` **_Example_**: `Google "40..100 search operators"`
  * in the example we'll get results including '48 search operators', '55 search operators', all the way from 40 to 100
* `$` **_Example_** `"best laptop" $150`
* `‚Ç¨` **_Example_** `‚Ç¨5 cloud server`
* `in` **_Example_** `1 inch in pixels`
  * The in operator converts different units of measurement. Result: '96 pixels'.

Even the basic search operators mentioned above can get pretty complex once you start combining them. However, even learning one or two can make your web-search a lot more effective.

### Advanced Search Operators

> Advanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.

* `intitle:` **_Example_**: `intitle:"40..100 search operators"`
  * This is a new one to me that I'll definitely be making use of.  It ensures the results have your search term in the title, not just anywhere on the page.
* `inurl:` **_Example_**: `allintitle:(google search operators) inurl:2020`
  * This time we're finding results that have all the words 'google search operators' in the title and '2020' as part of the url, in that case, a bit of a hack to search by date, but offering many more possibilities.
* `intext:` **_Example_**: `intext:(parameters . operators . boolean)`
  * Now we're looking for an article with the words 'parameters', 'operators' and 'boolean' ([AND, OR, NOT](https://www.lotame.com/what-is-boolean-logic/)) in the text, regardless of its title.
* `filetype:` **_Example_**: `"search operators" filetype:pdf`
  * This returns results of a specific type of file, in this example PDF, but any text based file type can be found in this mannar.
* `related:` **_Example_**:	`"search operators" related:google.com`
  * Return sites that are related to a target domain. This only works for larger domains, in this example I'm looking for results found in websites connected to Google.
* `AROUND(X)` **_Example_**:  `search AROUND(3) operators`
  * Returns results where two terms are found within (X) words of each other. This can be helpful when you search for two words, but get a bunch of results where the words are so far apart they have no relation
* `site:` **_Example_**: `intitle:"search operators" site:news.ycombinator.com`
  * This query is a favorite of mine, and we'll go into more detail below. In this case, we're looking for posts on the Hacker News Forum with 'search operators' in the title.
