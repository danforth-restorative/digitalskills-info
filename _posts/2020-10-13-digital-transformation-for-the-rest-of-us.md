> Digital transformation is all about becoming a digital enterprise—an organization that uses technology to continuously evolve all aspects of its business models (what it offers, how it interacts with customers and how it operates). - [Digital transformation: A PRIMER](https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2019/10/deloitte-digital-transformation-a-primer/)

Digital transformation is a popular buzzword used to describe the practices that corporations, and government bodies around the world, use seeking to remain relevant in the digital age. 

Since the creation of the World Wide Web in 1990, and the introduction of electronic payments a few years later, megalithic industries have been brought to their knees, and the opportunities for anyone with an internet connection have been rapidly on the rise.

I grew up with computers, as the world wide web was taking flight. I've always been able to make a computer do what I needed, but I had no profitable ambitions, and didn't recognize the massive opportunities I was letting slip through my fingers.

A few years ago, after I quit drinking and gave up a freewheeling lifestyle, I needed to create a new life for myself and decided to get serious about tech. 

I could see clearly how, if I had been focused growing up – if I had consistently created and worked towards almost anything, online – by now I would have likely found my way into a number of profitable ventures. I could see also, just as clearly, that the potential is even greater than ever, and I'm not letting that opportunity pass me by.

## The Sky's the Limit.

When you first start working online, and you're starting at the bottom without a degree or relevant skills, you have to start the same place as everyone else. There are freelance sites like fiverr and upwork, there's micro jobs and click work (think surveys and random small web tasks) with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and there's transcripts. 

I started out writing some freelance articles on tech trends like AI and Blockchain. I didn't know anything about those subjects, but I was willing to accept low paying gigs to learn about them. While doing research for these articles, I was constantly irritated by the mass quantity of fluff content. 

I spent a ton of energy reading about these topics and figuring out where reliable information lived, with the aim to  create the most detail rich articles with plenty of references so the readers could easily continue exploring, and verify the source of essential details. I began collecting sources for a variety of subjects and thinking about how to make it easier for people to share internet research findings with eachother to lighten the load for everyone.

From there, I became far more interested in curation than writing, and started doing some contract based research work. I've listened to thousand of podcasts, binge listening on every topic that catches my interest. I spent some time reading hacker news and tech twitter, all day every day. 

In that way, I've learned how various industries communicate and sharpen each others knowledge, and sought to discover the scope and boundaries of various technical domains and their intersection with more traditional fields, such as finance, law, and journalism. 

Since then I've learned to use Linux, OSX, and how to use tools written in a variety of different programming languages. I've learned to deploy web applications for free in the cloud, publish static websites for free on GitHub, and used AWS Free Tier for tasks including automatic machine learning transcriptions, and creating my own vpn. 

### You can get paid to learn

Online, you can learn basically anything for free. You can even get paid to learn! 

> Learning isn't always the highest paid job in the world, but the benefits are incredible.

One problem with all of this is that there isn't a strong consciousness around what are the fundamental digital skills? What should you work on first, when creating an online business? 

The answer to what you need to learn first will be different for every person, and depend on what you come to the table with. Even having a strong digital literacy, starting out, I had no clues how to go about building a career online, and spent a lot of effort grinding away and figuring things out the hard way. 

## The hardest parts of learning online

While there's a lot of educational resources online, much of the content is published with the intent of growing profit, not necessarily to inform and edify the masses. Especially starting out, it can be really difficult to find quality sources. 

The hardest part is sifting through the search results, to find useful bits of information, and figuring out the right keywords for your query. Multiply that by the multitude of things you have to know, at least until you get a general idea of where to find different types of information online. 

I took a rather winding path, on my journey to having marketable digital skills. Looking back, there were a number of more direct routes I could have taken, if I had some concise map of the territory to begin with.

None of the problems around developing digital skills are particularly hard, but today's educational paradigm is stuck in the 1800's somewhere, and the incentives of educational institutions rarely seem aligned with the interests of their students.

### A Not for Profit Educational Organization

That's why I'm creating a Not for Profit Educational Organization, who's students will teach each other digital skills. Members of this organization get the opportunity to learn digital fundamentals by building the schools curriculum and knowledge base. A portion of membership fees goes to paying students for helping eachother in chat, answering questions in a forum, creating wiki entries, content, courses and other organizational structures.

One of the peculiarities of this organization will be that I would cap the payment made to any individual, by the organization to $2000. This probably won't be an issue in the beginning, because a lot of work needs to go into building out a wiki with all the essential information related to fundamental digital skills, and really a ton of work before i imagine the organization bringing in enough funds to reach that cap.

All the same, you never know. If we can get 10 or 20 members within the first year, a couple of them could work together and create a highly profitable paid newsletter, another few could develop some courses... in the digital marketplace, the potential for exponential growth is always present. 

That's part of the idea with having a pay cap is to ensure that the purpose of the organization is always the education of it's community, not profit. At the same time, it will support a recognition of the internet as a place where people can earn an income, even a living, while pursuing their passions. 

### The long tail

> long tail is a business strategy that allows companies to realize significant profits by selling low volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers, instead of only selling large volumes of a reduced number of popular items. - [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-tail.asp)

[![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*7icMcrpJlpcBaxlN)](https://medium.com/briq-bookings/how-will-long-tail-affect-the-leisure-branch-dec45338a5a)

My take on the long tail is that, as an individual, you could choose the even most obscure niche subject or product. You've got the entire internet as a market. If you need 2000 bucks a month, you only need 20 customers to pay you 100 bucks a month, or 40 customers to pay you 50 bucks a month, or 200 subscribers to give you 10 dollars a month.

It's just a matter of finding your market, and figuring out some product they will be happy to pay for because it meets their needs. If you start with something you really care about, that you would even do for free, that reduces the chance you'll burn out and give up before finding success.

This turns upside down the old argument of pursuing your passion because there's no work available. In todays world, you really can make a living focused on philosophy, latin, or other subjects we've been told to leave behind for the sake of a career.

### DigitalSkills.Info

I like to think of DigitalSkills.Info developing into something like a start up incubator for the uninitiated. It will support members in the most difficult early stages of learning to think and grow digitally. By the time members have completed the first few learning tiers, they will have nurtured a supportive community by helping others in areas they are experienced with. 

If you've advanced enough that a course you created with the organization starts approaching your earning cap, by then you'll already have some of your own independent projects going on the side, and be well prepared to launch your own ventures where the profit potential is unlimited.

I'll be seeking a grant to cover my first years, minimal viable income, which would enable me to focus on this project with the vast majority of my time and efforts. That would also ensure that the entirety of membership fees would go towards the building the organization, and going back it's members, in proportion to their contributions while developing their talents.

## Not Only a Technical Education

The purpose of this organization is, not only, to create a community of people who teach each other digital skills, while learning to build an online business, by building the DigitalSkills.Info organization. It's also to empower people to learn deeply on subject they are passionate about, and to make valuable information more accessible to the masses.

Our wiki will include, not only, technical how-to guides and curated lists of tools and information on a variety of subjects. It will also focus deeply on information related to mental hygiene, personal development, social dynamics and important social issues of the day, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, and #METOO, learning to be anti-racist and anti-sexist.

If we disagree on any of these topics, we can do our web search and battle it out in the wiki. The most fundamental digital skills, in my estimation, are search and curation. It's simple enough to type a question or a few keywords into google search. However, if you really want to excel in the digital world, learning how to get the most out of google and other services is invaluable. Curation is a powerful skill, once developed... but I'm not so sure that *anyone* is teaching that, just yet.

The idea of this is not necessarily for the organization to promote it's favorite propaganda, but for the members to create their own curriculum and pursue the topics they find valuable. We'll be exploring digital tools and skills within the framework of our members interests. 

## Digital Tools make the Digital Transformation

> More than 70% of all SMBs report revenue growth and attribute some of this growth to the use of digital tools. More digitalized SMBs have a higher likelihood of experiencing revenue growth than their less digital peers. - [The performance of Small and Medium Sized Businesses in a digital world](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/es/Documents/Consultoria/The-performance-of-SMBs-in-digital-world.pdf)

Basically any service available online that you might pay for, you can get "for free" if you're willing to get your hands dirty and run some code that isn't neatly packaged into a binary executable. Then again, you can get almost anything personal use for free, without troubling over command line instructions. Those tools will not be neglected in our curriculum, for members who'd like to avoid the command prompt.

Lets say you'd like to become a programmer, but there's a mountain of knowledge between you and there, and you don't even know where to begin. Maybe you want to start out learning to use developer tools, before jumping straight into coding. 

The fact is, there are a lot of super valuable skills between "I can use a computer" and knowing how to code. The important thing is to start out with some achievable goals, share your sucesses with the world and get some early positive feedback to keep you going. 

After running other peoples code for long enough, eventually I could understand enough to change a simple parameter, or slightly alter the code to get it running or suit my needs. One day I went to create a twitter quote bot in the Python programming language, and found that I could write my own script from start to finish, and set it up to run on a schedule for free with GitHub actions.

All that to be said, you don't even need to code to be super valuable online, but if you learn their tools you're capabilities are exponentially enhanced.

An essential element in creating your business online is to develop a mailing list. If I could go back three years ago when I started and do one thing, it would have been to start growing a list of e-mail subscribers from the start. You don't need any special skills to create a landing page when you're starting out, but there are plenty of ways to set that up for free with the click of a button.

If you have an idea you're passionate about, before you spend the next year building, spend a day or two to write a post describing that vision, with a sign-up form, at the end, for people who are interested in your idea.

Then, once you have something to actually share with people, you already have a list of people who asked you to e-mail them with more information! It doesn't matter if you aren't the kind of person who signs up for e-mail lists. The people who give you their e-mail addresses are then warm leads you already know are potential customers.

You'll get feedback on how others think about your idea, and if you get a lot of subscribers you'll really know you're onto something.

Either way, once you create a few landing pages, and share them in a few venues, you can begin collecting data, and learning more about your project. Then you can work at your leisure and passively collect subscribers. 

That's what this is post is all about. In the coming months I have a number of projects and articles that i'll be releasing to make the opportunities of DigitalSkills.Info more tangible. I have a personal knowledge base where I've been curating deeply on all of above, so while the project is ambitious, I'm prepared to create enough related content, for others to clearly see the value.
