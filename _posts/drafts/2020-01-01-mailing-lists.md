If I could go backOne valuable tool when starting any enterprise online is to [begin growing a mailing list](https://wpforms.com/why-you-should-start-building-an-email-list/). If I could go back and do one thing different, I'd start building e-mail lists for my favorite ideas, from the beginning.

You don't need any special skills to [create a landing page](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7177/what-is-a-landing-page-and-why-should-you-care.aspx), there are plenty of ways to set that up [for free with the click of a button](https://mailchimp.com/features/landing-pages/).

If you have an idea you're excited about, before you spend the next year building, spend a day or two to write a post describing that vision, with an e-mail sign-up form at the end for interested parties.

Once you create a couple landing pages, and share them in a few venues, you'll be [collecting data](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-data-collection), and learning more about your audience. Then you can work at your own pace, collecting subscribers and creating a market for your future offerings.

It doesn't matter if you aren't the kind of person who signs up for e-mail lists. The people who give you their e-mail addresses have already told you they're interested, once you've created something worth sharing, you have a list of warm leads for relevant product offerings.

You'll get instant feedback on how others think about your idea, if at all, and should you get a lot of inquiries, then you'll really know you're onto something.
