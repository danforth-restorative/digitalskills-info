## Google Search

This first section includes links and information straight from Google, itself.

* [Refine web searches](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en)
  > You can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise.
  > - Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn’t part of a search operator.
  > - Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won’t.

#### Order of Operations

When using search operators google has a specific order it uses giving preference to different operations.

* [Search Protocol Reference](https://support.google.com/gsa/answer/6329265#436b47a9-affc-48a8-869c-fff1dbd1abe0)
  > Boolean operators are left associative with equal precedence. You can use parentheses to change the order of precedence. For example, A . (B \| C \| D) evaluates the OR (\|) operators in the parentheses before the AND (.) operator. It is advisable to use brackets, braces, or parenthesis to clarify the precedence in complex queries.
