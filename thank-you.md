Thanks for signing up!

I'm not sure when I send out my first e-mail. I need to set up an auto-responder, to send an e-mail response when you've subscribed.

That's another project that will take some time before I can complete. Eventually I will clearly document all of the steps I've taken to start from "oh i have an idea" to a website with it's own domain name, e-mail forms, it's own e-mail server, and eventually however I figure out to auto-respond to subscriptions.

If you don't hear from me in a month, check your spam folder ðŸ¤£

No. Seriously. :)

Thanks again!
